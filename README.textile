h1. Simple Password Extension

A "Simple Password Page" page protects contents with HTTP Basic 
Authentication. The user name, password, and realm are set up in
a different page, with a special PassPage class.
   
The PassPage should have only one part ("config"), which has the
usernames and passwords in this pseudo YAML like format:
   
<pre><code>
       john: secret
       mary: lamb
       foo: bar
<pre><code>

   
I've also added a "New User" button on that page. It asks you for
a username, generates a random password and adds it to the page.
   
SimplePasswordExtension depends on the authenticate_with_http_basic and
request_http_basic_authentication methods, introduced with Rails 2, and
Radiant > 0.6.5. It also requires the Shards extention, which is included
in recent Radiant version.
  
This is a modified version of the original Simple Password extension
